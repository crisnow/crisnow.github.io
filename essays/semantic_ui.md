I have used Semantic UI to do several homework. From the atheistic prospective, it is more beautiful and elegant than the plain HTML and CSS. And I really like it, but when you try to do more, you will feel it is not very easy, even you try to read the documents again and search the sample codes from the internet. It is just not that easy to do whatever you like. Then I went to ask my friends, some of them has even never learned Semantic UI, but they have learnt the Twitter Bootstrap before. This remind me that perhaps the web development is really one of rapid developing areas in the world. New things are always coming out. Same as the semantic UI, perhaps now is the trend for it.

Just as the first few WOD we did in Browsehistory #1,#2 and #3, we used the HTML and CSS, the web looks ok, but then we turn to the Semantic UI, the web is much more modern and fashion. Also like the homework I did yesterday, which asked us to copycat any website we like, I have selected an online shopping website Ohii (https://www.urbanoutfit ters.com/ohii) although the website I made by Semantic UI is not totally the same as the original one, but I have to say the one I copied is as same beautiful and neat as the real one. Thanks to Semantic UI, I can do this within several days’ learning. 

Perhaps in the future, there are more popular front-end framework show up, but the logic we studied today should still apply in any frameworks.
