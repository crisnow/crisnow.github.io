Different coding standards tells the different computer languages. You will feel this sentence very true, when you switch to different languages, especially some statistic based language, such as Python. It uses the indention instead of brackets to create the function, therefore the coding standard become very different. This is very amazing for me at first place. Then when we learn some language such as Python, you will feel that when formatting the codes well, the language will be not that difficult to study and the codes will be so easy to read.

The coding standard can tell a good programmer and a bad one or say a beginner one, the people who first learn programming will always not care too much about the coding standards. No matter how messy the codes, if it can run, they will feel satisfied. However, when the professionals see the messy codes, they can not help making a good format for it and persuade “new baby” to follow a good coding style, I think there are two reasons, first of all,  your code is not just for today’s use, you may have to back to the code you wrote in the middle way, or you have to reuse it some day. Second, when you work as a team, everyone follows the same standards, it will make the things easy.

After my first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, I actually feel that ESLint is very useful, at first, you may feel that to get the green check is a trouble and pain, but later you see it often and used to it, once it is not there, you will want to figure it out and find the mistakes.
