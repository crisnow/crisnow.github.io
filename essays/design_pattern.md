I have a sweater which is brought by a European friend as a gift, with some nice pattern ( as the picture below). I liked it very much, when the winter came, I wore it to meet my another friends who also comes from European countries, he said the sweater looked so familiar because of the patterns, and he asked me if I bought it from Europe. I did not surprise that he did not know how I get the clothes (since at that time I was still in Asia), but can recognise the sweater immediately from his home town. Yeah, because of the pattern, it is difficult to miss the origin of the sweater.

The product has the pattern as well as the software engineering, we also have the patterns when we design the programs, after I read all the materials, I feel that the software design pattern can help the newbies, even the programming professorial. Because with some patterns, you are difficult to forget something. just like the sweater pictures, every snowflake has eight petals, how the one we design only has seven or more than nine? Is it anything wrong with our design. Undoubtedly the design pattern can help us to find out the problems, and finally solve them. Also for the newbies of computer science, life will be much easier if we follow some patterns, because for the new hand, if we have some pattern in mind, we have some hints to start programming, even at first we do not have idea what it is and understand all the concepts, but it is a quick way to start and foster thinking later.

This is also remind me when we start to do the meteor and react, the digits website, we use the liststuff, stuff, etc. copy and paste them, change the name and some parts of the contents in program, is it a software pattern? Maybe yes, maybe no, but I feel in this way, I can do everything very easily, and if I want to modify more, I will have to dig deeper and understand all. But at the beginning, I am not building something from nothing, that will be frustrating.

At last, I feel that I still did not understand the software design pattern a lot, since it is not an easy topic, but it is also so interesting and I should do some research in the future.
