<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/javascript.jpg">*Javascript Relection*

This is my first week to learn the Javascript, I feel it is a little bit easier than Java. For example, in Java we have the switch statement or if else statement, but it needs a lot of syntax. However, in the Javascript, we can use an array to represent it as:

var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["cool!"]
};

Also in the workout of the day, the solution for the first exercise, the foreach statement is also suprising, the javascript sometimes is like the R, SQL and Python, some statistical softwares, which many functions are built-in and makes things much easy.


## Javascript is very useful

JavaScript is the native language of the web browser. Therefore, it is the basic language for web development. Web developers have no choice in the matter. I have viewed many job posting, the companies needs the employee with the Javascripts skills. On the other hand, JavaScript is very useful to add cool effects on the website. That is the reason why I want to learn it well. 

## Summary
At last I feel that I am very happy to learn a new computer language, I have learnt C, R, Java,SQL and some Python before. I want to know if I can learn it very quick.
